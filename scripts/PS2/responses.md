### Question 2: Part (d)

No, I don't think this sequence is realistic. Proteins have micro environments of amino acids
with properties directed toward a task, the presence of one AA modifies the probability that one will follow
next in the sequence. For example: Cys forms disulfide bridges that covalently hold some proteins together.
While the probability of one Cys is low it increases significantly with the presence of another Cys residue.
