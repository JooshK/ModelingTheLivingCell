## Homework 2: Written Questions

### Question 2: 

#### Part (d)

No, I don't think this sequence is realistic. Proteins have micro environments of amino acids
with properties directed toward a task, the presence of one AA modifies the probability that one will follow
next in the sequence. For example: Cys forms disulfide bridges that covalently hold some proteins together.
While the probability of one Cys is low it increases significantly with the presence of another Cys residue.

### Question 4: 

#### Part (a)
The number of ways to permute n particles without restriction is n!. So we would have 8! arrangements of 8 distinct 
particles. However, there are only two types of particles (B or W), so we need to divide by the number of permutations
in each group of 4 particles. Therefore, the number of permutations total is 8!/(4!*4!) = 70. 

#### Part (b)
Let B be the event "All four black particles are on one side of the membrane". This arrangement is one of 70 possible, 
so P(B) = 1/70 = 1.43%. 

The number of arrangements of 4 particles in 2 groups of size 3 and 1 is 4!/(1!*3!) = 4 arrangements, so the prob is 
4/70 = 5.7%. 

The number of arrangements of 4 particles in two groups of equal size is 4!/(2!*2!) = 6. So the probability is 
6/70 = 8.5%.

The most likely arrangement is the one with 2 black and 2 white particles on one side of the membrane. 

#### Part (c)
There is only one black particle on the right side of the membrane when the initial configuration on the left is 
BBBW, so there is a 1/4 chance of switching with the black one on the right. However, the particle chosen from the left 
is also random, and there is a 1/4 chance of picking the W one, so there is a 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 chance of switching to 
BBBB. 

There is a 3/4 chance of picking a B from the left and a 3/4 chance of picking a W from the right. So there is a
(3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 chance of switching to a conformation with two black and two white particles on the left. Intuitively 
we can see that this option has more combinations and is more likely.
